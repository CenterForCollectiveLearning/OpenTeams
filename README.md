# OpenTeams

OpenTeams is an open source suite for visualizing team data. You can try a demo version of openteams at openteam.info. 

OpenTeams was developed by Jingxian Zhang as part of her Master thesis at the Collective Learning group at the MIT Media Lab, under the supervision of Professor Cesar Hidalgo. OpenTeams builds on Immersion, a project to visualize individual email metadata created at the MIT Media Lab by Daniel Smilkov and Deepak Jagdish, also under the supervision of Professor Cesar Hidalgo. In addition to the work of Jingxian Zhang, OpenTeams includes the work of Xiaojiao Chen and Diana Orghian, who contributed to OpenTeams by helping, respectively, with graphic design and social psychology expertise.
